## Solution

I've looked at Github repositories with AUCTF in it, using search in Github. There were not a lot at the time of the challenge.

![githubauctf](../images/whomademegithub.png)

I've looked at them one by one, and repo by `chharles` looks suspicious because empty.

Yet we see 6 commits, so let's look at them. In one of them we see the flag.

Flag: `auctf{G1tHuB_4lwAY5_r3mEmB3r5_8923_1750921}`
