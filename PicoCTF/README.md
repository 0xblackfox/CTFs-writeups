# PicoCTF

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a free computer security education program with original content built on a capture-the-flag framework created by security and privacy experts at Carnegie Mellon University.

It has a great set of resources to learn how to CTF, as well as a picoGYM to practice in a non competitive environment.

Challenges difficulty range from very beginner (never used Linux) to advanced.

This folder will contain writeups for interesting practice challenges.
